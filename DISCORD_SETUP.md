## ✨ What This Does:
- **Automatic Discord Integration** - All task completions go straight to Discord
- **No Backend Server** - No need to run Node.js or manage servers
- **Simple Setup** - Just create a Discord webhook and you're done!

2. **Right-click on the channel** where you want task reports
3. **Click "Edit Channel"**
4. **Go to "Integrations" tab**
5. **Click "Webhooks" → "New Webhook"**
6. **Copy the webhook URL** (looks like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789/abcdef...`)

### Step 2: Configure Extension
1. **Open the extension**
2. **Click "Settings"**
3. **Select "Discord Webhook"**
4. **Paste your webhook URL**
5. **Click "Save Settings"**

### Step 3: Test It!

2. **Complete a task**
3. **Submit proof**
4. **Check Discord** - you should see a message!

## 📱 What You'll See in Discord:

### Registration Message:
```
🆕 New Sub Registered
Welcome sub_a1b2c3d4! Ready to serve and complete tasks.
```

### Task Completion Message:
```
✅ Task Completed
👤 Submissive: sub_a1b2c3d4
📋 Task: daily-worship
⏰ Completed: 7/12/2025, 2:30:00 PM
🔗 Proof: https://example.com/proof.jpg
```

## 🔧 Advanced Options:

### Multiple Subs
Each user gets a unique alias automatically:
- `sub_a1b2c3d4`
- `sub_b2c3d4e5`
- `sub_c3d4e5f6`

### Custom Aliases
You can set custom aliases in the extension storage if needed.

### Multiple Channels
Create different webhooks for different channels:
- **Tasks Channel**: Daily task completions
- **Proofs Channel**: Photo/file submissions
- **Reports Channel**: Weekly summaries

## 🎨 Message Features:

### Rich Embeds
- **Color-coded**: Green for completions, purple for registration
- **Timestamps**: Automatic Discord timestamps
- **Fields**: Organized information display
- **Proof Links**: Direct links to submitted proof

### Automatic Info
- **Sub identification**: Unique alias for each user
- **Task details**: Full task name and completion time
- **Proof handling**: URLs and file type indicators

## 🔒 Privacy & Security:

### What's Sent to Discord:
- ✅ Random alias (e.g., "sub_12345678")
- ✅ Task name (e.g., "daily-worship")
- ✅ Completion timestamp
- ✅ Proof URL (if provided)

### What's NOT Sent:
- ❌ Real names or personal info
- ❌ Browser data or tracking
- ❌ File contents (only URLs)
- ❌ Location or device info

## 🚨 Troubleshooting:

### "Discord submission failed"
1. **Check webhook URL** - Make sure it's correct
2. **Test webhook** - Try posting to it manually
3. **Check permissions** - Make sure webhook has send permissions

### Messages not appearing
1. **Check the right channel** - Webhook posts to specific channel
2. **Check webhook status** - Make sure it's not deleted
3. **Check browser console** - Look for error messages

### Extension not working
1. **Reload extension** - In chrome://extensions/
2. **Check permissions** - Make sure Discord permissions are enabled
3. **Clear storage** - Reset and try again

## 📞 Quick Test:

To test if your webhook works:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"content": "Test message from KFD Task Tracker!"}' \
YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Discord-Only:

### ✅ Pros:
- **No server setup** - Works immediately
- **No maintenance** - Discord handles everything
- **Mobile access** - Discord apps everywhere
- **Notifications** - Discord pings and alerts
- **History** - All messages saved in Discord
- **Sharing** - Easy to share channels with others

### ❌ Cons:
- **Limited features** - No admin dashboard
- **No database** - Messages only
- **Discord dependent** - Requires Discord account

## 🎉 You're Done!

This setup is much simpler than the full backend solution. Perfect for:
- **Quick testing**

- **Small groups**
- **Mobile monitoring**

Just create the webhook, paste it in settings, and start using the extension! All task completions will appear in Discord automatically.

**Need the full backend later?** You can always add it back by changing `API_CONFIG.enabled = true` in popup.js and running the Node.js server.
